# SkillSync - Your Personal Learning Navigator üß≠

SkillSync is an intelligent learning navigator that creates personalized roadmaps to help you achieve your career and skill goals. This project is a frontend implementation of the SkillSync concept, showcasing a modern, responsive user interface built with Tailwind CSS.
